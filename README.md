We need to create a simple service for viewing weather information.

         When creating a service, the following conditions must be met:
                 It is necessary to use the React framework and responsive design so that the page opens on any consumer-grade device.
                 The user should either be able to select from a list the city for which he needs a weather forecast.
         The user should be able to view data for the following time periods:
                 “now” (for the day);
                 “the next five days” (by day for five days).
         Data must be requested via OpenWeather's One Call API.

         To deploy the project, do the following:
          - We take the repository git clone https://github.com/olexiygolovko/weather_viewing_service
          - Go to the root folder of the project
          - Install modules and dependencies: npm install
          - Build the project: npm run build
          - Start the DevServer server: npm run start
          - We admire the project.
